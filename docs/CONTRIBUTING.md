# Contributing to Radon Forge Projects

First off, thank you for considering contributing to a Radon Forge project! We're on a mission to forge the future of gaming, and we're excited to have you on board. Your contributions, big or small, make a huge difference.

This document provides a set of general guidelines for contributing to our open-source projects. These are guidelines, not rigid rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## ü§ù Code of Conduct

All our projects and communities adhere to the [Radon Forge Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [abuse@radonforge.com](mailto:abuse@radonforge.com).

## ü§î How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, including:

- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting enhancements
- Improving documentation
- Submitting pull requests with new features or bug fixes

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check the existing issues to see if someone has already reported it. If not, create a new issue using the **"Bug Report"** template. Be sure to include as much detail as possible so we can reproduce and fix the bug efficiently.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, we'd love to hear about it! Please check the existing issues and feature requests first. If your idea is new, create a new issue using the **"Feature Request"** template.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are typically well-defined and a great way to get started.

When you're ready to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`.
2.  **Make your changes**. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
3.  **Write tests** for your changes.
4.  **Update the documentation** if you've added or changed any features.
5.  **Submit a pull request** using the provided template.

## üöÄ Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` or other relevant documentation with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the `README.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

Thank you for your contribution!

**Radon Forge** ‚Äî Forging the future of gaming.
