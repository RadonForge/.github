## ‚ùì How to Get Help

We're here to help! If you have a question, run into an issue, or need support for a Radon Forge project, here are the best ways to get it.

### 1. Check the Documentation

Before reaching out, please check the project's `README.md` file and any available documentation on our website at [radonforge.com](https://radonforge.com). Your question might already be answered there.

### 2. Open an Issue

If you can't find an answer in the documentation, the best way to get support is to **open an issue** in the relevant GitHub repository. We use GitHub Issues for all our project-related support.

Please use one of the available issue templates to help us understand your problem:

- **üêõ Bug Report:** If you've found something that isn't working as expected.
- **‚ú® Feature Request:** If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement.
- **üí¨ Question:** For all other questions or to start a discussion.

Using the templates helps us gather the necessary information to help you more effectively.

### 3. Community Discussions

For more general discussions about our projects or game development, feel free to engage with the community where available.

Thank you for using Radon Forge projects!
