# Radon Forge Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for projects maintained by Radon Forge. Our goal is to create a clear and transparent process for contributions and decision-making.

## Guiding Principles

Our governance is guided by the values outlined in our company profile:

- **Community First:** We build with our players and developers, not just for them.
- **Long-Term Support:** We are committed to the life and evolution of our projects.
- **Meaningful Innovation:** We adopt technology that enhances the experience.
- **Uncompromising Quality:** We prioritize quality over arbitrary deadlines.

## Roles

- **Maintainers:** These are individuals from Radon Forge who are responsible for the project's overall health and direction. They have write access to the repository and are responsible for reviewing and merging contributions.
- **Contributors:** Anyone who contributes to the project through issues, pull requests, or other means. Your contributions are highly valued and essential to the project's success.

## Decision Making

- Most decisions are made through community consensus. We encourage discussions in GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- For minor changes, such as bug fixes or documentation updates, contributors can open a pull request which will be reviewed by a maintainer.
- For major changes, such as new features or architectural modifications, we recommend opening an issue first to discuss the proposed changes with the community and maintainers.
- In the event of a disagreement that cannot be resolved through discussion, the project maintainers will have the final say to ensure the project stays aligned with its long-term vision.

## Amending This Document

Changes to this governance document can be proposed via a pull request and will be reviewed by the Radon Forge team.
